##### DATABASE models
    For your Pinterest clone, you’ll likely need four main database models in MongoDB using Mongoose:

    User Model – Stores user details like username, email, password (hashed), profile picture, and bio.

    Pin Model – Represents a single post with an image, title, description, creator ID, and timestamp.

    Board Model – Allows users to group pins into collections, with a name, description, and linked user ID.

    Comment Model – Stores user comments on pins with content, creator ID, pin ID, and timestamp.

    Like Model – Stores likes on pins, linking users to the pins they have liked (user ID, pin ID, timestamp).

You might also need a Like Model if you plan to track reactions, but the basics should cover essential functionality!
